# Personal Tutor

This project allows you to upload PDF files, and it will extract the text from those files and generate questions based on the content. You can answer these questions, and the chatbot will provide feedback on your answers. Let's get started!

## Getting Started

1. **Upload PDF Files**:
   - On the left sidebar, you can upload one or more PDF files that you want to study. Simply click the "Load your PDF" button and select your PDF files.

2. **Click "Validate"**:
   - After uploading your PDF files, click the "Validate" button. This will initiate the chatbot and start generating questions based on the content of the PDF files.

## Chat Interface

Once you've clicked "Validate," the chat interface will appear below. Here's how it works:

- You'll see messages from "Richard Feynman," your personal tutor, in the chat.
- Richard Feynman will ask you questions one by one.
- You can type your answers in the chat input box.
- After you submit your answer, the chatbot will provide feedback on whether your answer is correct, partially correct, or incorrect.

## Example Interaction

Here's an example of how the interaction might look:

- Richard Feynman (Assistant): "What was the conclusion of the article?"
- You (User): "That homeopathy is innefective."
- Richard Feynman (Assistant): "Great job! Your answer is correct."

The chatbot will continue asking questions and providing feedback until you've completed the session.
